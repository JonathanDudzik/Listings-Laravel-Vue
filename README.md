# Portfolio Project: Listings Laravel with Vue App

## Project Overview
I built this full stack web application on the VILT stack: Laravel for the MVC backend, Vue 3 for the front end, Inertia for a single page app with server-side routing, and Tailwind for utility-first CSS. I use this tech stack for larger projects that need a backend and when I need to create an MVP quickly with the option to scale up later.

## Vue 3 Single File Components for the Win Again
Over the past seven years working with Vue, I have always appreciated the unique benefit of Single File Components (SFC) compared to other common JS frameworks. To me, SFC helps me compose cleaner components and scale those components up when needed. Vue just feels like a natural extension of the classic trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Laravel Conventions for a Better Model View Controller Development Experience
I migrated from Ruby on Rails to Laravel back in 2022. I use Laravel because it makes use of my previous experience as a WordPress developer and includes many conventions that help me build out my backend faster. Inertia.js bridges the gap between the frontend and backend, allowing me to build single-page applications using classic server-side routing and controllers.

## Development Lifecycle and Best Practices
Being that I have built this application on production-tested frameworks, there is a standard and modern workflow for application development that provides the following benefits:
- Efficient ways of debugging and handling errors for both the frontend and backend.
- Consistency across any hosting environment, including local, cloud, or on-premise.
- Version control with Git.
- Issues reproduced and tracked easily.
- Detailed audit trail for all changes.
- Reduced risk of unwanted changes and the ability to correct them before they go into production.
- Changes can require code peer review, approval, and tests before being deployed into the production environment.
- Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) is possible.
